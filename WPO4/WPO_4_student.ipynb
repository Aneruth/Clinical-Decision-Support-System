    "### Goal\n",
    "The goal of this practical session is to get an insight into logistic regression modelling using real life medical data from patients infected with COVID-19. Your tasks will involve building different models to predict disease severity and analyze the relations between different variables and severity risk. Students must send their notebook using the Assignment functionality of Canvas before the __25th of March, 2022, 23:59. Remember to include the HTML format!__ The grade from this practical session will contribute to your final grade.\n",

    "***\n",
    "In this practical session you will predict the severity of the COVID-19 outcome, based on the analysis of patient information and the corresponding computed tomography (CT) images features of COVID-19 suspects and actual patients.\n",
    "***\n",
    "#### COVID features dataset\n",
    "Have a look at the provided COVID datasheet (*COVID_data.csv*) with multiple features describing various COVID patients and suspects. The dataset consist of 2000 data points with multiple features, each datapoint representing an actual COVID-patient or a COVID-suspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of the feaures provide the following information:\n",
    "*   *PatientID*: ID of the patient\n",
    "*   *Age*: Age of the patient categorized into one of 6 categories to limit the risk of deanonimization.\n",
    "*   *Sex*: M or F - patient gender\n",
    "*   *Covid*: indicates whether the patient had a confirmed COVID infection\n",
    "*   *Severity*: for COVID patients, indicates whether the disease was severe (need for intubation or caused patient death)\n",
    "*   *Image_size* and *Spacing* are CT image parameters used for imaging\n",
    "*   *GGO*: Proportion of the lung with GGO. Ground glass opacity (*GGO*) refers to the hazy gray areas that can show up in CT scans or X-rays of the lungs. These gray areas indicate increased density inside the lungs. The term comes from a technique in glassmaking during which the surface of the glass is blasted by sand.\n",
    "*   *Consolidation*: Proportion of the lung with consolidated lessions. A pulmonary consolidation is a region of normally compressible lung tissue that has filled with liquid instead of air. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two last features (*GGO* and *Consolidation*) were extracted from CT images of patients with COVID, or suspects of having COVID, and the ratio to the total lung volume is provided.\n",
